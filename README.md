# Predicting-Climate-with-Machine-Learning-

Introduction: 
This project aims to detect and analyze climate change patterns using machine learning techniques, specifically rigid regression. The project utilizes historical climate data to train a model that can predict future climate trends and detect significant changes indicative of climate change.

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

Clone the Repository: Clone this GitHub repository to your local machine using the following command:

               git clone  https://github.com/yourusername/climate-change-detection.git

Install Dependencies: Ensure you have all the necessary dependencies installed. You can install them using pip:

                pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the Code: Once you have the repository cloned and dependencies installed, you can run the code to train the model and detect climate change patterns.

Dataset:
 The dataset used for this project contains historical climate data, including temperature, precipitation, humidity, and other relevant features. The dataset is not included in this repository due to its size, but it can be obtained from [source].

Model Training: The model is trained using rigid regression, a machine learning technique suitable for detecting linear relationships between variables. The training process involves preprocessing the data, splitting it into training and testing sets, and then fitting the model to the training data.

Results: The trained model can be used to predict future climate trends and detect significant changes indicative of climate change. Evaluation metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R2) are used to assess the performance of the model.
